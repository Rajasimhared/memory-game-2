# Memory Game inspired by F1

Inspired by the preparation games that F1 drivers play in order to improve their concentration, focus and coordination, I built this game containing one dimensional blocks. On start, player has to memorise the block blink sequence and select the sequence once the blinking stops. The score would go up and also the frequency of blinks would go up as the player succeeds.

We show the score and high score on the top of the screen.
